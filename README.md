# BrainJam21
I have worked with my younger brother (13 years old) on this project. I worked on the development side while he took care of the arts. We used blender for the level design and character design and got the animations from mixamo. The Voice and some noise were recorded and edited, while the background music is downloaded from a free music site. The rest was done on unity3
